## Adversarial Noise Generator

The Adversarial Noise Generator is a Python library designed to introduce adversarial noise into images. This noise is crafted to trick pre-trained image classification models into misclassifying the altered image as a specified target class, while maintaining the original image's appearance to human viewers.
